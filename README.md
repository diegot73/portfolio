## Diego Toscano's Portfolio

<p>This repository showcases a collection of <b>specification documents</b> I developed during my role as a <b><ins>Business Analyst</ins></b>, alongside my recent <b>Python projects</b> implemented in Jupyter Notebooks. These projects, created during my tenure as an <b><ins>NLP Engineer</ins></b> and <b><ins>Prompt Engineer</ins></b>, span key areas such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and Generative AI (GenAI), reflecting my technical expertise and hands-on experience in these domains.</p>
<p><i><b>(NOTE</b>: Data files were not included due to confidentiality issues).</i></p>
<p>There are 4 folders: Watson Assistant, ML-NLP, GenAI and Business Analysis.</p>
<p>- <b><ins>Business Analysis</ins></b>: some of my specifications in the projects I worked on can be found here (Company's name and sensitive information were deleted): 
  <ul><li>Sr Business Analyst Challenge (BA_Sr_Challenge - FinanceDigitalBanking.pdf file)</li>
    <li>Software Requirements Specification (ERS_GestionDocumental_v1.pdf file)</li>
    <li>Use Case Document (CU-GenerarSimulacion.pdf file)</li>
    <li>API Specification docs (Especificacion-API... files)</li></ul></p>
<p>- <b><ins>Watson Assistant</ins></b>: When I was a curator of a virtual assistant (Watson Assistant), I used IBM's own APIs to analyze the bot's development skill and to test utterances to be able to train it better.</p>
<p>- <b><ins>ML-NLP</ins></b>: There is a bit of everything, such as: 
<ul><li>Analysis of conversations of some datasets (wordcloud).</li>
  <li>Text Clustering by Similarity (topics) using NLP and Machine Learning libraries.</li>
  <li>Creation of Clusters and Bigrams based on the input utterances</li>
  <li>... and some examples of NER and Text Similarity.</li></ul></p>
<p>- <b><ins>GenAI</ins></b>: I applied generative AI for different use cases, such as: 
  <ul><li>Interview with an applicant for the cashier position and evaluation of the candidate.</li>
    <li>RAG: file on cooking recipes and questions about different recipes.</li>
    <li>Topic Generation through GenAI according to a dataset of bigrams and trigrams.</li>
    <li>From a log of conversations between a customer and a customer service assistant (CAD) obtains through GenAI: the topic, what the problem was, and whether it was resolved or not.</li></ul></p>
