## My Portfolio

<p>In this repository there are some Jupyter Notebooks that I developed in my last jobs as an AI/NLP Engineer.</p>
<p>There are 3 folders: Watson Assistant, ML-NLP and GenAI.</p>
<p>- <b>Watson Assistant</b>: When I was a curator of a virtual assistant (Watson Assistant), I used IBM's own APIs to analyze the bot's development skill and to test utterances to be able to train it better.</p>
<p>- <b>ML-NLP</b>: There is a bit of everything, such as: 
<ul><li>Analysis of conversations of some datasets (wordcloud).</li>
  <li>Text Clustering by Similarity (topics) using NLP and Machine Learning libraries.</li>
  <li>Creation of Clusters and Bigrams based on the input utterances</li>
  <li>... and some examples of NER and Text Similarity.</li></ul></p>
<p>- <b>GenAI</b>: I applied generative AI for different use cases, such as: 
  <ul><li>Interview with an applicant for the cashier position and evaluation of the candidate.</li>
    <li>RAG: file on cooking recipes and questions about different recipes.</li>
    <li>Topic Generation through GenAI according to a dataset of bigrams and trigrams.</li>
    <li>From a log of conversations between a customer and a customer service assistant (CAD) obtains through GenAI: the topic, what the problem was, and whether it was resolved or not.</li></ul></p>
